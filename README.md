Optimizely OX Segment Generator Chrome Extension

This is a Chrome extension designed for Optimizely users.

Function: With an experiment open in a Chrome tab, clicking the extension will automatically open all default Optimizely segments. On Optimizely, it is a pain to click through each segment. This extension makes it easy and saves time.

Stages
<br>v1.0 current stage is set to open default segments
<br>v2.0 (in progress) will allow show a settings/dashboard that store segments and associated parameters. Users are able to add additional segments and parameters, as well as select which segments to open in new tab.

Further implication: The concept of this extension is to append n parameters (of fixed value) to a base url (of variable value). For example, when testing a landing page, and desire is to append multiple parameters, the extension allows parameters to be appended easily and opens urls in new tabs. This extension is most useful to users that have many n parameters of fixed value and many n based urls of variable value. At this point, the extension would exceed it's original purpose and be seen as a "Add parameters to URL and open in new tab" extension (to come in v2.0).
